Imagine controlling your computer with your eyes. This is what Meyes does. It is a simple python script that uses the dlib library to detect the eyes and move the cursor accordingly. It also uses the pyautogui library to click and double click.

## Installation


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
python eye_control.py
```

## Flow of Control

- [x] OpenCV to capture the video from the webcam
- [x] Google‚Äôs MediaPipe to detect the face and the eyes
- [x] PyAutoGUI to move the cursor and click
